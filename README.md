# CCCdb!v1.0

CCCdb(cell-cell communication database): A comprehensive manually curated database for cell-cell communication in human and mouse. 

# What is CCCdb?

One of the most fundamental questions in biology is: which cells communicate with each other during organismal growth, development, immune responses, and the pathogenesis of complex diseases. There is an urgent need for an expert-curated reference database comprising experimentally validated, gold-standard CCCs support the development of computational inference tools.

Here, we present CCCdb (https://bio.liclab.net/cccdb/index.php), a comprehensive and expert-curated database of cell-cell communications that have been experimentally validated in human, mouse. CCCdb integrates 1,646 publications and 8,553 curated entries, including 3,389 cell-cell pairs and 1,274 cell types. It spans the broadest temporal range (1973–2025) and supports all four major communication modes: direct contact, autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine.

Notably, CCCdb incorporates an AI-assisted querying system based on the ReAct agent architecture, enabling users to submit biological questions in natural language. The system automatically translates these into structured SQL queries and retrieves relevant cell–cell communication information.
